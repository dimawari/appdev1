## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub
I want to learn Git and GitHub because they'll be essential for me and my progress of learning. Plus, it's where we submit our projects and at the same time, it serves as a digital portfolio for the projects I've partaken to, providing credentials that will help me back up my claims for the role I want. Furthermore, I just found it cute while keeping things minimalist and not overwhelming as I explore how it functions.
