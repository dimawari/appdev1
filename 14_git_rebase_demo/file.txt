What did you notice about the commit history after rebase?
- I saw that after the rebase, the commits from the feature branch were "replayed" on top of the latest commits in the main branch.
This means the commit history looks linear, as if the feature was developed after the hotfixes. The commit hashes of the feature commits also changed, since rebase rewrites commit history. 
Overall, the history is cleaner and avoids merge commits.
