Realization: What did you notice about the commit history after switching from macro to micro commits?
- I've realized that  it's much better to practice micro commits especially non-coders like me to avoid commiting irreversible actions that might affect the code.
Also, in macro commits, I've noticed that all of my  files went gone after reverting, unlike in  micro commits.
