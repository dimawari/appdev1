# Internet of Things

## Purpose:
The core purpose of IoT (Internet of Things) is to connect devices to the internet for data collection, sharing, and analysis. This enables remote monitoring and control, boosting efficiency and reducing manual work. From smart homes (like app-controlled lights and thermostats) to businesses (tracking assets and optimizing operations), IoT simplifies daily tasks, offers useful insights, and enhances productivity.

## Usage
### __In Education:__ ###
IoT is used in education to implement learning management systems, allowing teachers to remotely structure lessons, monitor the effectiveness of educational programs, and track student progress. It enables students to access courses, take tests and exams anytime and anywhere, and retrieve all necessary learning materials—such as videos and textbooks—in one centralized system. Additionally, IoT provides real-time access to educational resources. It is also used in application management solutions, helping institutions manage education as a business by enabling faster decision-making, extracting and processing data, and supporting data-driven improvements through a network of smart sensors.

### __In I.T:__ ###
In IT, IoT is used to develop interconnected systems that collect, process, and share data between devices. This involves designing architectures, integrating cloud and edge computing, and ensuring secure communication between components. IT professionals use IoT to enable real-time monitoring of networks, automate processes, and improve decision-making through data analytics. For example, in smart infrastructure, IoT sensors can detect performance issues and trigger automated responses, while in cybersecurity, IoT data streams help identify and respond to threats more quickly. By building the frameworks and safeguards for IoT systems, IT ensures that these technologies operate efficiently, securely, and at scale.

## Examples

**In Education:**
Pen Scanners leverage camera technology and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to capture and process printed text. For example, C-PEN offers a reading pen that can read text aloud, define highlighted words, store scanned text, and record voice memos. They also designed a translator pen that uses nine OXFORD Academic and ELT dictionaries to translate and pronounce words, helping international and non-native English-speaking students understand topics faster and do research more effectively.
